        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, and celery to the pot. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the meat and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break up the meat into smaller pieces as it cooks. Drain off any excess grease.</li>
            <li>Pour in the beef broth and bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper flakes. Stir until well combined and add the bay leaves. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste the sauce and adjust seasonings, as necessary.</li>
            <li>To cook the spaghetti, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti to al dente, according to package directions. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaves from the sauce. Add the spaghetti to the meat sauce in the pot and use tongs to toss until combined. Alternatively, plate the spaghetti and top with meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Garnish with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.</li>
        </ol>
